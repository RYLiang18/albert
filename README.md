ALBERT is a front-to-back webapp that I developed and hosted on AWS while learning the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, & NodeJS) web-dev stack. This projectâ€™s purpose is to keep track of playersâ€™ points in board games across multiple playing sessions. Looking back, ALBERT could have been much simpler by using something like Firebase Cloud Firestore instead of MongoDB and Express, but I am still glad that I used the MERN stack since I still learned a lot from it.

As a computer science student and someone who still plays boardgames in the digital era, I figured that creating a point-keeping webapp would be a great way to learn about backend development while creating something useful to me and my friends. With ALBERT, gone are the primitive days of using paper and pencil to track player points ðŸ˜‚!

Even though this project only scratches the surface of the MERN stack, building out my own backend taught me a lot about REST APIs, CRUD, differences between HTTP and HTTPS, NoSQL databases, hosting backends with AWS EC2, hiding API keys with gitignore, and much, much more. On the frontend side of things, I learned a lot about React component lifecycles, React Router, and using Axios to send HTTP requests. Since creating this project, my free AWS EC2 instance has expired, so I plan to look into other backend hosting services like Heroku.
